      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a Frontend developer and I'm pursuing my BCA degree from Veer Kunwar
        Singh University. In the past two years, I`ve learned so many things
        except programming languages such as C++, Java, HTML, CSS3. My problem
        solving is increased I`m calmer, polite. Trust this isn`t enough in this
        world. Learn things which are trending in the market like Python. Most
        importantly work on your body, personality etc. Keep experimenting with
        new things.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have experience working with modern frameworks and libraries such as
        React,which allows me to bring dynamic and interactive elements to life.
        I take pride in writing clean, efficient code and am always on the
        lookout for new technologies and best practices to improve my workflow
        and the quality of my work. Collaboration is at the heart of what I do.
        I enjoy working closely with designers, backend developers, and
        stakeholders to bring ideas to fruition. My goal is to bridge the gap
        between design and technology, ensuring that every project I work on is
        not only visually appealing but also highly functional and accessible.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, I'm either learning about new trends in web
        development, experimenting with UI/UX designs, or contributing to
        open-source projects.
